# September 2021 Workshop: Calibration NTuple Analysis with Python

This repository contains information to do calibration type analysis with python. We only need python libraries to do this: **no C++**, **no ROOT**, **no art**, **no LArSoft**. This is very helpful for iterating quickly on analysis and also enables work to be done off the FNAL servers. 

We will be using the following python packages:

[**uproot**](http://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4) For opening ROOT files (pure python library!)

## How to Install

To install the python packages you will need **python 3** and **pip**. I have scripts in this repository for getting this setup on the FNAL servers. If you are installing on your own machine, and are not sure if you have the required stuff, see: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/.

Then, run:

```
# clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/SBNSoftware/sbntutorials.git
# enter the correct directory
cd sbntutorials/0921-Calibration-Workshop/jupyter
# ON FNAL
source setup_<detector>.sh # Where <detector> is sbnd or icarus. If not on an FNAL server -- don't worry about this!
# make a virtualenv
python -m venv env
# Active the virtualenv
source env/bin/activate
# Install the python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

In a terminal with the activated virtual environment, run:

```jupyter notebook --no-browser```

And open the link that is printed in a web browser. If you are running jupyter notebook on a FNAL machine, you will need to 
forward it to your local machine. To do this, **ssh** into the FNAL server with the flag:

```-L <port>:localhost:<port>```

Where ```<port>``` is the port that jupyter notebook opens with. By default, it is 8888.

Then, open **DemoICARUS.ipynb** on the file browser.
