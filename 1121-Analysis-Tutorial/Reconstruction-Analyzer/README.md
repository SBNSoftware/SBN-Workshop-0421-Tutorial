This directoy contains code for an example analyzer of reconstruction
output in ICAURS. To use this as a template for some analysis work, copy
these files to an empty sub-directoy of whatever environment you are
working in. Then make sure to include the new sub-directory in the 
relevant CMakeLists.txt file!
