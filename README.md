# `sbntutorials`

This repository contains code and information from past tutorials for SBN.

Recordings of past tutorials are also available. They are stored in [SBN DocDB](https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/DocumentDatabase) and flagged at least with _both_ the topics `Physics and Analysis` and `Software`>`Tutorials` (but not necessarily `Software` by itself).
See as an example [SBN DocDB 24024](https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/ShowDocument?docid=24024).
